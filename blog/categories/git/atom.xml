    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Two posts ago, I dropped a hint about a basic ruby gem I was trying to build. At the time, building one&rsquo;s own gem(s) seemed to be the <em>de rigueur</em> object of our collective fascination at Flatiron. I guess that&rsquo;s because we were all itching to start building things, and we hadn&rsquo;t yet begun to learn Rails.</p>

<p>So I&rsquo;m a little late to our gem-party, but I&rsquo;m so happy I gave it a go (better late than never, right? Cue: mental reminders about &lsquo;unrealistic self-expectations&rsquo;). Because inevitably, the thing you learn most about through the process of gem-building &mdash; as is the case with absolutely anything you&rsquo;ll ever build with code &mdash; is git.</p>

<p>Only joking.</p>

<p>But really, I did actually learn an unexpected amount more about git. And with that said, since everyone loves lists, here&rsquo;s a list of 5 simple tips and lessons from my personal experience with ruby gem-building:</p>

<br>




<h3>1. Just start with the RubyGems Guide. Like, seriously.</h3>


<p>Don&rsquo;t waste hours debating your starting point. Just start with the <a href="http://guides.rubygems.org/make-your-own-gem/">RubyGems Guide</a>. Having done precisely the opposite &mdash; I ditched the guide in favor of a Treehouse video tutorial then got confused and ended up coming back to the guide &mdash; I know now that the RubyGems Guide is actually the easiest thing to follow. It walks you through the process of building a simple &ldquo;Hello World!&rdquo; gem, and without having to worry much at all about project directories or structure, you can build and ship your first ruby gem in about 15 minutes.</p>

<h3>2. Then try a tutorial, like this one</h3>


<p>Once you&rsquo;ve familiarized yourself a bit with basic directory organization and in which directories stuff should go, you can then follow along with <a href="http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/how-to-build-a-ruby-gem-with-guest-sam-soffes">this Treehouse tutorial</a> to build your real gem. The main reason I suggest you wait until you&rsquo;ve practiced with the RubyGems Guide first before diving into a tutorial like this one is that the latter instructs you to run this simple command as your starting point:</p>

<p><code>bundle gem &lt;the name of your gem&gt;</code></p>

<p>This will perform a bit of magic for you &mdash; not unlike the Rails/DHH magic we have at our disposal with the <code>rails g scaffold &lt;the name of your project&gt;</code> command &mdash; and instantly create a bunch of directories with files that have placeholder text and stuff in them. While this might sound totally awesome, it can also be confusing to use this as your starting point because you won&rsquo;t know why things have been set up the way they have. Which is to say, it will be harder for you to customize stuff to suit your needs &mdash; because you won&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s going to cause the whole thing to break and what&rsquo;s okay to change.</p>

<p>So build your directories and files from the ground up yourself first (following the RubyGems Guide), THEN take advantage of shortcuts like <code>bundle gem &lt;the name of your gem&gt;</code>.</p>

<h3>3. Don't forget, you're using git</h3>


<p>If you do go off of the <code>bundle gem</code> shortcut, be aware: it initializes a git repo in your project directory automatically.</p>

<p><img src="http://stephaniehoh.github.io/assets/screenshots/git_init_ruby_gems.png"></p>

<p>Yes. Look at the last line! <code>Initializing git repo...</code> it says. Somehow, I didn&rsquo;t pay attention to this detail, so later down the road when I pushed my first version of the gem up to rubygems then instantly realized I had to make an edit and push up a new version, I ran into a huge wall. I kept getting error messages that said something along the lines of &ldquo;[some_file_name, some_other_file_name] are not files&rdquo;. And I thought &ldquo;WHY??! WHAT DO YOU MEAN THEY AREN&rsquo;T FILES? I&rsquo;VE SAVED EVERYTHING, I CAN SEE THEM IN MY DIRECTORIES, THEY EXIST! OF COURSE THEY&rsquo;RE FILES!!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Well. Turns out, my computer wanted me to do a <code>git add .</code> and <code>git commit</code>  before I could proceed with pushing up new gem versions. This is because the <code>bundle gem &lt;the name of my gem&gt;</code> shortcut initialized a git repo for me, which meant I had to start tracking my changes. The fact that I&rsquo;d forgotten this and/or hadn&rsquo;t paid attention to the activity in my console from the get-go didn&rsquo;t change the fact that I now had to answer to git.</p>

<h3>4. Make sure your gem-name isn't already taken</h3>


<p>The problem I ran into above (and the subsequent 3 hours of de-bugging) was all due to this basic mistake: I&rsquo;d forgotten to make sure my gem name wasn&rsquo;t already taken. So after building everything and trying to run <code>gem push &lt;my gem&gt;</code>, I was promptly denied. This forced me to have to go back and make a lot of changes, including RENAMING MY GEM.</p>

<p>So just check first on RubyGems.org that your gem name hasn&rsquo;t already been taken! And don&rsquo;t assume, like I did, that it&rsquo;s necessarily something more complicated &mdash; like an error with my API-key (I ran around in circles trying to &lsquo;fix&rsquo; that for a while, when that was never the issue to begin with). It&rsquo;s really easy to get excited and just start building, and equally easy to jump to crazy conclusions as to where and how you should start debugging your errors.</p>

<h3>5. Handle your gemspec with care</h3>


<p>Your gemspec is not just some random file you can treat as an afterthought (as is often done unfortunately with README files, for example), just because it doesn&rsquo;t live in the &lsquo;all-important&rsquo; lib or bin directories. Your gemspec file is literally the roadmap TO YOUR GEM, or a blueprint, rather. It contains tons of valuable information such as your gem&rsquo;s version number, executables, and run-time dependencies, to name a few.</p>

<p>Furthermore, as you can see, when you actually run the <code>gem build &lt;yourgemname.gemspec&gt;</code> command to BUILD your gem, you have to build it off of the gemspec! It&rsquo;s just convention. Needless to say, your gemspec file is important. Update it, make sure it contains accurate information, and treat it with care.</p>

<p>================================================================</p>

<p>All of that said, I had a lot of fun building my first gem. Special shoutout to our TA Spencer Rogers for helping me de-bug and ultimately realize that my 3-hour roadblock had, in fact, stemmed 100% from git troubles.</p>

<p>My gem is called <code>billboard_chart</code>.</p>

<p>You can install it by running <code>gem install billboard_chart</code>.</p>

<p>Then simply type <code>billboard_chart</code> to see what happens!</p>

<p>(NOTE: 24 hours after I published my gem, Billboard.com decided to switch up some of their CSS selectors so now the scraper generating my data &mdash; I used Nokogiri &mdash; is acting funny, which means the data also looks a bit funny now. Looks like I now have some ACTUAL de-bugging to do!!!)</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I meant to write this post last week, when I had my first Git/GitHub breakthrough. In my first post &mdash; after Day 2 at Flatiron &mdash; I bemoaned the fact that everything I&rsquo;d attempted to absorb about Git and Github had, by the end of the day, turned into unpalatable git soup. A week later, after enough exposure and repetition (and causing one too many merge conflicts), I was able to strain some method out of the git soup-madness.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s start by establishing a key concept: <b>Git and GitHub ARE NOT THE SAME THING</b>.</p>

<p>They&rsquo;re not??? But, like, programmers refer to them (seemingly) interchangeably!</p>

<p>Nope. Still not the same. They work hand in hand, but this doesn&rsquo;t equate to&hellip;. sameness.</p>

<h3>SO WHAT IS GIT?</h3>


<p>Git can seem like total madness for a number of reasons, not the least of which because&hellip; well, GitHub&rsquo;s sheer existence. The latter has added a whole slew of very niche terminology to an already-extensive list of GIT-specific terminology: i.e, there&rsquo;s more shit to memorize. Anyway, you can think of Git as <b>a really awesome version-control software.</b> <b>You download it.</b> It lives <b>locally</b> on your computer. You run it <b>from your terminal</b>. You might be typing some Git-ish commands that look like this, from your command line:</p>

<p><code>git init</code><br>
<code>git add .</code><br>
<code>git commmit -m "some witty message here"</code><br></p>

<p>If you are, then you&rsquo;re using Git &mdash; NOT GitHub.</p>

<p>And what exactly, by the way, is &ldquo;version-control software&rdquo;? It&rsquo;s basically just a handy program you install on your computer &ndash; just like when you download and install cool things like Skype &ndash; except you install Git from your command line. Which makes you really cool. Oh, and what it does: a million things. But two fundamental ideas are that:</p>

<p>1) <b>Git allows you to save different &ldquo;versions&rdquo; of your work as you go</b> &mdash; via adds and commits. As long as you&rsquo;ve installed Git on your computer and you do a <code>git init</code> in whatever directory you&rsquo;ll be doing your work, you can start saving versions of your work. And &ldquo;work&rdquo; really means anything; it could be Photoshop edits, essay drafts, spreadsheet modifications, you name it. It just so happens that if you&rsquo;re a programmer, you&rsquo;ll mostly be using Git to keep track of all your versions of code.</p>

<p>2) <b>Git lets you create and work on something called &lsquo;branches&rsquo;, which are basically parallel universes that you can switch back and forth out of interchangeably</b> &mdash; via <code>git checkout &lt;branch_name here&gt;</code>. If that&rsquo;s still confusing to you, imagine if you could make as many copies as you wanted of your EXISTENCE, i.e seven different parallel universes, and in each of them, you can run around and live out a different version of your life that you&rsquo;ve ever dreamed. When you feel like one particular universe has yielded the perfect outcome (you&rsquo;ve become the next Jay-Z, met the man of your dreams, have been elected President of the United States), you can throw away the other six and decide &ldquo;I ONLY WANT TO KEEP THE ONE WHERE I BECOME PRESIDENT.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s kind of how branches work. You get to make and work in as many as you want, and when you write code that you&rsquo;re happy with in any one of them, you can say, &ldquo;THIS IS THE BRANCH I WANT TO KEEP&rdquo; and throw the others away.</p>

<p>Then we get into merging and pushing and some advanced Git topics that I&rsquo;ll chronicle in future posts (when I&rsquo;ve actually wrapped my head around them). But this poses a natural segueway into GitHub.</p>

<h3>COOL. NOW WHAT'S GITHUB?</h3>


<p>Remember how I said Git lives locally on your computer? Well, GitHub is the exact opposite: <b>it lives remotely, on the Internet.</b> That&rsquo;s right &mdash; as its name would suggest, GitHub is an online &lsquo;hub&rsquo; that some really smart dudes built so that programmers could share their code remotely and collaborate on projects at the same time. It&rsquo;s kind of like the flashstick/Dropbox analogy &mdash; sure, the flashstick was small and compact and mostly useful, but what if you wanted to access everything on your flashstick remotely? On the Internet? Especially if, like, you didn&rsquo;t have your flashstick with you?? Sorry, no can do. Until Dropbox came along! Suddenly, you could access ALL your files from any computer, as long as you had an Internet connection and as long as you&rsquo;d explicitly added those files to Dropbox! Similarly, I like to think that GitHub is to Git what Dropbox is to the flashstick (yes, I know this is an oversimplification but if you just think about the remote-access part of the analogy, it works).</p>

<p>So if you&rsquo;ve got an Internet browser open, and you&rsquo;re typing &ldquo;www.github.com&rdquo; and hit enter, and you can see the Octocat mascot, you&rsquo;re using GitHub &mdash; NOT Git. And why is this distinction so important? Well, that&rsquo;s like asking why it&rsquo;s important to understand that the files on your computer won&rsquo;t be accessible remotely unless you MAKE them &lsquo;remote&rsquo; somehow, say, by uploading them to Dropbox. As long as you understand that <b>GitHub is a remote entity to which you&rsquo;re &lsquo;pushing&rsquo; (i.e uploading) stuff that would otherwise only exist locally</b>, you&rsquo;re in good shape.</p>

<p>This will save you a lot of confusion and heartache down the road when you&rsquo;re wondering why stuff you&rsquo;re adding and committing locally isn&rsquo;t magically appearing online on GitHub (chances are, you did a <code>git init</code> locally first then forgot to create a &lsquo;pathway&rsquo; between your computer and GitHub via <code>git remote add origin &lt;some GitHub URL&gt;</code>).</p>

<p>Anyway, I&rsquo;ll be doing more Git and GitHub posts down the road because I don&rsquo;t think any existing manuals on the Internet have really done an <em>excellent</em> job at illuminating how they work together (or explaining what they are, for that matter, hence this blog post). Even more egregious, in my opinion, is the lack of sensible visuals (most Git diagrams suck and have only confused me more) and the dearth in helpful analogies &mdash; so I&rsquo;ll try to provide a little of both.</p>

<h4>KEY TAKEAWAYS</h4>


<ol>
<li>Git lives locally, on your computer</li>
<li>GitHub lives remotely, on the Internet</li>
<li>You can store and access your work online, on GitHub, but only if you EXPLICITLY SEND IT THERE &mdash; i.e via a <code>git push</code></li>
<li>What you do locally on your computer doesn&rsquo;t just magically appear remotely online; you need to create the pathways and make the explicit commands</li>
</ol>
