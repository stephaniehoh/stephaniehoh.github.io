I completed day two at the Flatiron School today. My head is spinning with all the new concepts and terminology I've been trying to absorb from the last 48 hours -- deploying, raking, branching, rebasing, adding, committing, and merging. Everything is sort of merging into git-soup, at the moment. 

But I learned some handy keyboard shortcuts that I can wrap my head... err, fingers around. Like command + tab to navigate around my open applications. And command + space to summon Spotlight. It sounds silly, but I didn't used to know these things. I've learned more about my computer in the last two days than I ever have. 

Goodbye, track pad?

Hello world.
